# COVID19_Game
A simple game about COVID-19.

# Introduction
The system that was first developed by Sir Aatief, my CSC 2301 Intelligent Systems instructor, a simple game to measure one's knowledge about COVID-19 that had been developed using Python.
Then I had to modify it to improve visibility in both the code and the application.

# Future
Add a prediction module.
